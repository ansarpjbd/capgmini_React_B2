//Runtime Exception 




//Exception -it is error in java

//there are two type of error

//Syntax error
//it is identified by the compiler and code will not be compiled
//there is no solutions you have to correct it


//Logical error
//Logical error is called exception 

//1. Checked Exception --check at compile time and throw a error


//2. Unchecked Exception--which is not check at compile time 

//Each Exception have some name
//Exception will break the flow of program
//wrong input /output
//we can handle the exception using try catch block
//we can take the input again 
//or we can show proper message to user
//Whenever you some class Each class throw exception

//Exception Handling --
//try
//{
//it will look for exception
//}
//catch()
//{
//catch will handle the exception
//}

//try and catch block needs to use togather

		//int a=10
